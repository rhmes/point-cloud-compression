# Step 1: Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv_cpu
source venv_cpu/bin/activate

# Step 2: Upgrade pip and core tools
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

# Step 3: Install additional project requirements
pip install -r requirements_cpu.txt

# Step 4: Ensure torch is available before installing PyTorch3D
python -c "import torch; print(f'Torch version: {torch.__version__}')"

# Step 5: Install PyTorch3D from source (must be last)
# Delay helps pip recognize torch in the environment

pip install "git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d.git"

# Step 6: Install Open3D
# Note: Open3D is installed via pip for CPU compatibility
